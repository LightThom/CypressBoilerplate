## Set Up

### Install Visual Studio Code

[Install VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

### Install NPM Node js

[Install node-js-and-npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

## Usage

### Working with Page Objects

A page object represents a part of your web application. A web application might have a home page, a listings page and a about page. Each of them can be represented by page object models.

Page objects simplify authoring by creating a higher-level API which suits your application and simplify maintenance by capturing element selectors in one place and create reusable code to avoid repetition.

### Working with Indexes

An index represents a collection of pages/classes within the framework in a single file.

Index's can be imported to reduce the number of imports across files, reducing maintainability, reducing code and simplifying the code.
